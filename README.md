# Team Integration RFCs

## Why?

RFC stands "Request For Comments". You are making/represent/worry
about a product you're involved in.

## Process

1. Mention this in the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/8DaoreZr/bi-weekly-salt-python-developers-meeting)
2. Checkout this repo
3. Create a meaningful branch
4. Copy `template.md` and rename it your way
5. Create a pull request
6. Mention people you want to discuss or ask something
7. Accept the PR once issue has been resolved

## How not to make it horrid

Please let us not to turn all that into a beurocratic nightmare where
people writing RFCs and no code. Therefore:

- Bugs are not discussed here. Just fix them in Bugzilla.
- PRs are not discussed there. You already coded it, discuss it there.
- Tasks in your Trello are not discussed here. Just start doing them.
- Keep it narrowed to the very topic. Be very specific.
- Keep it simple, stupid.
